# CS501

This repository is created by Cabbage and for CS 50100. It includes all the materials related to homework and solutions. The code is well commented and structured.  
Version 2.7 is mainly used in Python programming. If you really want to run these codes with python 3 or above, you'd better check the differences between python 2 and 3 and then make a change. (e.g., usage of print is a little different in python 2 and 3.)
I hope all of you can enjoy this class and get good grades!
